# Logarithm

- Logarithm gives us the rule to simplify some mathematical calculation.

- Any positive real number _N_, can be represented in two ways :-
  1. Exponantial representation
  2. Logarithmic representation

<pre>
let N = 36. 

- Exponantial representation
    - 6^2 = 36

Where, 
6 = Base
2 = Power/Exponent/Degree

- Logarithmic representation
    - log6(36) = 2

Where,
6 = Base
36 = N
2 = Power/Exponent/Degree
</pre>

- In Exponantial representation we try to get the N, with the help of the base case and the exponent.
- On the other hand in Logarithmic representation we try to get the value of the exponent, with the help of N and the base case.

- Hence, we can say Exponantial representation is nothing but a way to calculate _anti-log value_. One thing which we will keep in mind is the _log_ itself dosen't hold any value this is just a symbol. It dosen't hold any kind of vlaue.

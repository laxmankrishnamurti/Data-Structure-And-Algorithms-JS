# Chapter - 05 (JavaScript Array)

- Array :: Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures. It is also like a variable but the special thing is that it can store multiple values within a single variable. Their data-type may vary.

For any data structure, developers are interested in time and space complexity associated with the four fundamental operation: Access, Insertion, Deletion, and Search.

- Time complexity of <code>.push()</code>, <code>.pop()</code>, <code>.unshift()</code> ....etc is O(n) in theory. But it should be noted that practically, this totaly depends on the JavaScript engine that runs the code. This applies to all natively supported
  javascript object.

- Unlike Java and c++, JavaScript does not have multidimensional arrya. Instead of this, there are jagged arrays.

- What are jagged array?
-
- A jagged array is an array whose elements are an array itself.
-
- Ex :- let numbers = [[1,2,3], [2,2,4], [6,7,2]]
- The element of jagged array can be of different dimensions and sizes.

// And doing practice on arrays, jagged array.

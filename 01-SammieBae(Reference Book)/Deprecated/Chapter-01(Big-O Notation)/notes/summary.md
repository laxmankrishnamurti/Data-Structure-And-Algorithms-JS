# What is Big-O Notation?

The Big-O Notation measures the worst-case complexity of an algorithm. In Big-O Notation, n represents the number of inputs. To be more precise, Big-O Notation is important because it tells us how efficient an algorithm is.

- O(n)

# What does it mean by "Worst-case complexity"?

It refers to the maximum amount of time(& number of iterations or operations) or resources(such as memory) that an algorithm will require to complete its task.

# Common Big-O complexities.

- O(1) :: It does not change with respect to input sapce. Hence, O(1) is referred to as being constant time.

  Ex :- Accessing an array's element by it's indexing value.

- O(n)

  - "Worst-case scenario"
  - Linear time

- O(n^2)

  - Quadratic time

- O(n^3)
  - Cubic time

# What exaclty Time-complexity is?

Time complexity dosen't mean that how long an algoright takes time to accompolish a task but instead of this what time complexity is "How many numbers of operations that an algorithm requires to accompolish the task as input grows".

Hence, Time complexity is directly perposnal to the number of operations.

If number of operations reduces as input grows then we can say that the algorithm is best in that case. OR number of operations increases not to much as relative to the number of inputs grow.

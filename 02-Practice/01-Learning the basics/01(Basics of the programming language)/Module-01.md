# Basic Input/Output

## Input

In JavaScript to input a value we use _promt()_ method.

```javascript
let userInput = promt("What is your name?");
if (userInput) {
  console.log("username is", userInput);
}
```

Before rendering the DOM on the webpage browser will ask to the user to input their name.

## Output

To display value on the console/terminal(in node.js) we use _console.log()_. Typically, it is mostly used for debugging purpose(Regular logging).

- console ===> Object, provided by javascript (We can think of it like a class)
- log() ===> This is a method of the object

There several methods in console object for example :-

- console.error(message) ===> To display errors on the console.
- console.warn(message) ===> To diaply warnings on the console.
- console.info(value) ===> It's a way to differentiate between regular logging (console.log) and messages that are meant to convey general information or updates.

```javascript
console.log("This is a regular log message"); ===> Align with terminal color
console.info("This is an informational message"); ===> No color (But some browser marked with blue color)
console.warn("This is a warning message"); ===> Marked with yellow color
console.error("This is an error message"); ===> Marked with red color
```

# Data Types

Before storing values int the memroy computer must know the type of data so that it can distribute the required spaces to the value in its' memory.

But because of the dynamic nature of javascript helps programmer to do not worry about the data types too much as compare to strictly typed language such as C, C++, Java, ...etc. It dosen't mean there is no data types are in javascript. It also has several data types but before moving further let's understand what is dynamic and static language?

## Dynamic vs Strictly typed language

Let's make it simple...

1. Dynamic Programming Language

   - Code will not give any kind of type errors if there is no syntax error while compile time.
     - In Dynamically typed language we only see errors if there is any syntax issue that interpreter can intercept.
   - It will throw errors if there is any kind of _type errors_ during it's runtime.
   - Dynamically programming language does not care about the data types too much, interpreter can interpret the type of the data.

2. Statically Typed Programming Language
   - These programming languages's compiler are very strictly check the type of data.
   - It will throw errors during compile time not runtime because for such kind of programming languages type matters a lot.

## Data types in JavaScript.

JavaScript has 8 data-types. They are:

1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

<code>Note ===> The object data type can contain both **Built-in objects**, and **user defined objects**</code>

Built-in object type can be:

- objects
- arrays
- dates
- maps
- sets
- intarrays
- floatarrays
- promises
  and more......

<code>There are lots of methods, provided by JavaScript, which is associated with these data types</code>

```javascript
//Numbers
let price = 100;
const age = 21;

//String
let username = "Laxman Krishnamurti";

//Booleans
let isLoggedIn = true;

//Object
const user = {
  name: "Laxman Krishnamurti",
  age: 21,
  email: "laxmankrishnamurti@gmail.com",
};

//Array
const marks = [91, 98, 85, 75, 89];

//Date Object
const date = new Date();

//undefined ===> Variable is declared but value is not defined.
//null ===> Variable is defined but value is still empty.
```

<code>JavaScript variable can hold any type of data. Hence, we can say that javascript types are dynamic</code>

```js
let x; //undefined
x = ""; //Value is "" and the type is undefined
x = 21; //number
x = "Laxman Krishnamurti"; //string
x = true; //boolean
x = ""; //Output :- boolean ===> false
x = " "; //Output :- boolean ==> true
x = {
  //Object
  name: "Laxman Krishnamurti",
  age: 21,
};
x = () => {
  //function
  console.log("Hii there! what's up!");
};
```

- <code>When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as string.</code>

```js
let val = 21 + "laxman"; //Output :- 21laxman
let val = "laxman" + 21; //Output :- laxman21
```

- <code>JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:</code>

```js
console.log(10 + 20 + 30 + "laxman" + 21 + 10); // Output : 60laxman2110
console.log("laxman" + 21 + 10); // Output : laxman2110
```

The right part from the string will treated as a string not a number. Hence, it will concatinate like a string.

If the operand is a string then after that all values are treated as a string.

1. String

- Collection of characters
- With double or single quotes.
- We can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

```js
console.log("It's a must!") ===> Correct
console.log('It's a must!') ===> inCorrect
```

2. Number

All javascript numbers are stored as decimal numbers(floating point). Numbers can be written with, or without decimals.

```js
let age = 21;
let age = 21.0;
```

3. Exponential Notation

Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notatio.

```js
let num = 21e1; //Output : 210
let num = 21e10; //Output : 210000000000
let num = 21e-10; //Output : 21/10000000000 ===> 2.1e-9 (2.1 * 10^-9) or (2.1e-9)
```

<pre>
  Note
  Most programming languages have many number types:

  Whole numbers (integers):
  byte (8-bit), short (16-bit), int (32-bit), long (64-bit)

  Real numbers (floating-point):
  float (32-bit), double (64-bit).

  Javascript numbers are always one type:
  double (64-bit floating point).

</pre>

4. JavaScript BigInt

All JavaScript numbers are stored in 64-bit floating-point format. JavaScript BigInt is a new datatype (ES2020) that can be used to store integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number.

```js
let x = BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890");
console.log("x is", x); //Output : x is 123456789012345678901234567890n
```

<code>We can use the JavaScript _typeof_ operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.</code>

```js
let x = BigInt("123456789012345678901234567890");
console.log(typeof x); //Output : bigint
```

## If-else statement :: Conditional logic

```js
//Simple if-else statement
if(){
  //do this
}else {
  //do this
}

// Complex nesting
if(x){
  if(){
    if(){

    }else {

    }
  }else if(){

  }else{

  }
}else if(){
  if(){

  }else {

  }
}else {

}
```

## Switch Statement

- Works same as if-else statement but porvides a better way to write conditional logics.
- Switch cases use strict comparison (===). It means a case will only true if both type and values are same.

```js
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 0:
    console.log("Sunday");
    break;
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    console.log("Saturday");
    break;

  default:
    console.log("invalid input!");
}
```

If _default_ is not the last case in the switch block, remember to end the default case with a break.

```js
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  default:
    console.log("invalid input!");
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log("Friday");
  case 6:
    console.log("Saturday");
}
```

<code>Multiple case can use the same code block</code>

```js
let age = 20;
switch (age) {
  case 10:
  case 12:
  case 17:
    console.log("You are not eligible");
    break;
  case 18:
  case 20:
    console.log("You are eligible");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid input!");
}
```

#### Switching details

- If multiple cases matches a case value, the first case is selected.
- If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the default label.
- If no default label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) after the switch.

## Arrays

- Arrays are just like a vairble but rather than storing a single value it can store multiple values.
- It uses indexing to find the value in his bucket which has O(1).
- Indexing starts from 0.
- There are lots of methods, provided by JavaScript, are associated with an Array Object.

```js
let users = ["Laxman", "Anjali", "Fruti", "Vikram"];
console.log(users[2]); //Output : Fruti

users.push("Kawya Krishnamurti"); //adds the element to the last position
users.pop("Kawya Krishnamurti"); //remove and return the last element
users.find((ele, inde) => {
  return ele;
}); //Advance methods
```

## How do we know how many methods are there which is associated with the data - types?

Using _prototype_ properties.

```js
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(String.prototype));

//Output ===>
(52)[
  ("length",
  "constructor",
  "anchor",
  "at",
  "big",
  "blink",
  "bold",
  "charAt",
  "charCodeAt",
  "codePointAt",
  "concat",
  "endsWith",
  "fontcolor",
  "fontsize",
  "fixed",
  "includes",
  "indexOf",
  "isWellFormed",
  "italics",
  "lastIndexOf",
  "link",
  "localeCompare",
  "match",
  "matchAll",
  "normalize",
  "padEnd",
  "padStart",
  "repeat",
  "replace",
  "replaceAll",
  "search",
  "slice",
  "small",
  "split",
  "strike",
  "sub",
  "substr",
  "substring",
  "sup",
  "startsWith",
  "toString",
  "toWellFormed",
  "trim",
  "trimStart",
  "trimLeft",
  "trimEnd",
  "trimRight",
  "toLocaleLowerCase",
  "toLocaleUpperCase",
  "toLowerCase",
  "toUpperCase",
  "valueOf")
];
```

There are over 52 methods are there which is associated with the string.

```js
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Number.prototype));

//Output ===>
(7)[
  ("constructor",
  "toExponential",
  "toFixed",
  "toPrecision",
  "toString",
  "valueOf",
  "toLocaleString")
];
```

```js
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Array.prototype));

//Output
(40)[
  ("length",
  "constructor",
  "at",
  "concat",
  "copyWithin",
  "fill",
  "find",
  "findIndex",
  "findLast",
  "findLastIndex",
  "lastIndexOf",
  "pop",
  "push",
  "reverse",
  "shift",
  "unshift",
  "slice",
  "sort",
  "splice",
  "includes",
  "indexOf",
  "join",
  "keys",
  "entries",
  "values",
  "forEach",
  "filter",
  "flat",
  "flatMap",
  "map",
  "every",
  "some",
  "reduce",
  "reduceRight",
  "toReversed",
  "toSorted",
  "toSpliced",
  "with",
  "toLocaleString",
  "toString")
];
```

# Understanding the nature of JavaScript.

JavaScript is typically a prototype based programming language. For understanding, we can call it as an Object-Oriented-Programming language.

Prototype ===> An object has access of some other objects' properties and methods, the referenced object is called as the prototype of the object which is referencing to the object.

```js
let username = "Laxman Krishnamurti";
console.log("2nd character", username.charAt(1)); //Output : 2nd character a

function Admin(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  Admin.prototype.getUsername = function () {
    console.log("username is", this.name);
  };
  Admin.prototype.addUsers = function () {
    console.log(`${this.name} can add new members`);
  };
}
const user1 = new Admin("Laxman", 21);
console.log("user1", user1); // Output ==> user1 Admin {name: 'Laxman', age: 21}
user1.getUsername(); //Output ==> username is Laxman

function User(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
User.prototype = Object.create(Admin.prototype);
const user2 = new User("Pallavi");
user2.getUsername(); //Output ==> username is Pallavi
console.log(user2.name); //Output ==> Pallavi
user2.addUsers(); // Output ==> Pallavi can add new members
```

# Now, the question is that we are actually declaring a primitive variable and we haven't created any methods yet so from where these methods are coming?

As we know that JavaScript is a prototype based programming language which means JavaScript provides pre-built methods that we can use on the primitive values to perform some actions.

# How? Lets learn.

When we declare a string variable and try to console it using some methods like this

```js
let str = "Truth";
console.log("1st character is", str.chartAt(0));

//Output ===> 1st character is T
```

Before loading the program into stack first of all the JavaScript engine add a wrapper and this is nothing but the object which type is equal to the type of variable.

In this scenario we have declared a string so JavaScript engine add the String Object wrapper which consists all the string methods which is pre-built so that the engine can interpret that this is a type of string and the string variable is using the _charAt_ method to find characters on a specific location(or index).

## Pattern

1. Type declaration ===> Executed(on user-side) ===> Primitive at this point
2. JavaScript engine interpret all the types which is declared in the program and initialize the wrapper which consist all methods which is releated to the type
3. Add the wrapper ===> Now, the variable became the object
4. Executed
5. Wrapper unwinded
6. Now, the type will become primitive again.

## Ways to achieve inheritance

1. First

```js
Object2.prototype = Object.create(Object1.prototype);
```

2. Second

```js
function Object2(name, age) {
  Object1.call(this, name, age);
}
```

3. Third

```js
function Object2(name, age) {
  Object1.apply(this, name, age);
}
```

4. ES6 Module

```js
class Object2 extends Object1 {
  constructor(name, age) {
    super(name, age); // Calls Object1's constructor
  }
}
```

These are different methods to achieve inheritance, and class is often preferred for its simplicity in modern JavaScript.

## Loops

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

let i = 0;
while (i < n) {
  console.log(i);
  i--;
}

let j = 10;
do {
  console.log("Hello world!");
  j--;
} while (j < n);
```

# Functions

Functions are block of code that perform some specific task. Function is created for:

1. Modularise Code
2. Increase Readability
3. Re-usability

In JavaScript there are three types of functions and each function have kinds types

- Types of Functions

  1. Function declaration

  ```js
  function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
  ```

  2. Function expression

  ```js
  const sayHello = function () {
    console.log("Hello!");
  };
  ```

  3. Arrow function

  ```js
  const sayHello = () => {
    console.log("Hello!");
  };
  ```

- Kinds of function
  1. Void function ===> They do not return anything.
  ```js
  function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
  ```
  2. Return function
  ```js
  function sayHello() {
    return "Hello!";
  }
  ```
  3. Parameterised function
  ```js
  function sayHello(name) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
  }
  ```
  4. Non-parameterised function
  ```js
  function sayHello() {
    let name = "Laxman";
    console.log("Hello", name);
  }
  ```

<code>Arrow function's _this_ value is limited to their lexical scope in which it is declared.</code>

# Time Complexity

The rate at which the time, required to run a code, chagnes with respect to the input size, is considered the time Complexity.

Basically, the time complexity of a particular code depends unpon the input size.

**How we will represent the time complexity of any code:**

To represent the time complexity, we generally use the Big O notation. The Big O notation looks like the following:

_O() ===> Time taken by the code(inside the parenthesis)_

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

<code>The time complexity for this code will be nothing but the number of steps, this code will take to be executed. So, if we write this in terms of Big O notation, it will be like O(no. of steps).</code>

Let's observe the step for this code:

1. Initialization
2. Comparison
3. Printing
4. Increment

It will keep until the value of i will not reach at 10. Let's count the time complexity(the number of steps that the code is taken)

Three commong steps ===> Initialization, Comparison, Printing (3-step each time for 10 times)
Total number of steps ===> 10 \* 3 = 30
Time Complexity ===> O(30)

N istead of 10
Time Complexity ====> O(3\*n)

## Here come the three rules, that we are going to follow while calculating the time complexity:

- We will always calculate the time complexity for the worst-case scenario.
- We will avoid including the constant terms.
- We will also avoid the lower values.

# Space Complexity

The term space complexity generally refers to the memory space that a code uses while being executed. Again space complexity is also dependent on the machine and so we are going to represent the space complexity using the Big O notation instead of using the standard units of memory like MB, GB, etc.

<code>Space complexity generally represents the summation of auxiliary space and the input space. Auxiliary space refers to the space that we use additionally to solve a problem. And input space refers to the space that we use to store the inputs.</code>

# Points to remember

In competitive programming or in the platforms like Leetcode and GeeksforGeeks, we generally run our codes on online servers. Most of these servers execute roughly 108 operations in approximately 1 second i.e. 1s. We must be careful that if the time limit is given as 2s the operations in our code must be roughly 2*108, not 1016. Similarly, 5s refers to 5*108. Simply, if we want our code to be run in 1s, the time complexity of our code must be around O(108) avoiding the constants and the lower values.
